# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
Credit Card Fraud Detection is a critical application of machine learning in the realm of financial security. This project aims to leverage AI and ML techniques to detect fraudulent transactions, ensuring the safety of credit card users and mitigating financial losses for both individuals and financial institutions.

## Project Goals
- Develop automated models capable of accurately identifying fraudulent credit card transactions.
- Employ advanced machine learning techniques to create a system that can detect anomalies and patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior.
- Enable timely intervention and prevention of financial fraud through effective detection mechanisms.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for training and evaluation contains a large number of credit card transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent ones.
- Each transaction is characterized by various features such as transaction amount, time, and additional anonymized features to maintain confidentiality.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and prepare the dataset for training.
   - Perform feature engineering and scaling to enhance model performance.
2. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Utilize supervised learning techniques such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Train machine learning models using the prepared dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Fine-tune models to improve performance and generalization.
4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the trained model in a production environment for real-time fraud detection.
